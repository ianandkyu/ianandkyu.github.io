		<h1>Kyu's Place, January 30, 2019</h1>
		<h2>Ian: Okay so I’m just going to talk with Kyu now. Well you know this whole voice thing is that I’m doing these workshops to generate forms but the hardest f*cking thing is what do those forms say. Like yea you can make a dope ass typeface but what are you gonna call it, what are you gonna say with it. That’s my issue with my workshop project. Its cool and my voice gets involved with collectivity and all that stuff. But in the end the things that I make for the project are just going to be things to promote the workshop. 
		</h2>
<h3>Kyu: I mean you were talking about Karel Martens and Paul Eliman were sort of collecting artifacts of society. They were making type based on humanity in a way, based on our artifacts. And in that way it is a voice. There is a concept.</h3> 
<h2>Ian: Yea maybe I’m shorting myself. I feel pretty candid right now, so I think I could do this project with you. I feel like when we just talk… and the book can be just bullshit you know, but we can say some profound shit. Like you know Frank, I mean I keep going back to Frank. He puts these quotes by Gert next to a hiphop quote. And its like philosophy next to hiphop and philosophy is hiphop. What if the discourse takes a wrong turn and we start talking about JJs you know? I don’t think that necesarily bad. </h2>
<h3>Kyu: I think there has to be some narrowing down of what exactly we want to talk about. We cant just be like GRAPHIC DESIGN, thats the conversation, and we talk about graphic design. I think we have to start with topics that we are interested in. Maybe one of them is how you make type, or maybe one of the them is the importance of style. Similar things like how do we format ourselves to function in society. Like we all need a job and we’re all worried. Theres a certain anxiety that comes with it. </h3>
<h2>Ian: More about the conditions we are in.</h2>
<h3>Kyu: Yea, I mean in the end of the day the most important thing for me, is that I’m graduating. And I’m going be continuously making my work anyways, and I have been, and I will in my other class. But what I want out of my school year is sort of a culmination of thinking. Something that I can take away, these are the things I thought about and this is my friend that I thought them with. You know how Frank was talking about that Car thing? The project is the car. For me its not important whether the project is profound. I think the greatness comes in that it is honest.</h3>  
<h2>Ian: Is this your answer to your question about depression? Is like the honesty and not like performing the graphic designer position. But just making honest work. We’re having these conversations, we mean them, we’re not like trying to get a job from each other. We just honestly think these thoughts.</h2>
<h3>Kyu: I also think that we can play to our strengths to create a diverse amount of work. If we make a book I know how to do a good perfect bound. We have the idea of the website and you’re really good at coding. One of the ideas I was having was type specimens based on our thoughts. When you format the work around the actual thoughts of the designer, I think there is something interesting that happens. Whenever we see David Rudnicks work, its cool but its about a club. Like the work never represents what it is. In a way it is for that. We make the work to reflect the artist. But then you dissolve what the designer is. </h3>
<h2>Ian: its a very traditional mode.</h2> 
<h3>Kyu: I think shifting that focus into like the designers thoughts as the type specimen might just seem really fun. Like you have these really airy weird writing pieces that you do and you set it in your type. And it has this weird feeling, but you like it. </h3>
<h2>Ian: I f*cking don’t like it. I feel nothing when I look at work these days. Its Frakture. Its like your handwriting.</h2>
<h3>Kyu: Its like the knife thing. </h3> 
<h2>Ian: What? </h2>
<h3>Kyu: I was just looking at your presentation.</h3> 
<h2>Ian: Oh yea that is frakture too. What were we talking about? </h2>
<h3>Kyu: I mean you talked about Laurel Schwultz, and its similar to your work. And I was showing Jin, David Rudnicks work and he was like “isn’t that what you do?” and then I showed him onyx and he was like “thats what you do too.” and it comes to that. Like what we’re interested in and what we’re trying to get at in our work. I think it would be intersting if the work actually speaks that. I mean we don’t have to think about creating a finished piece. I think it will be a good platform to continue on as long as we can.</h3> 
<h2>Ian: No back cover. I literally blew your mind.</h2> 
<h3>Kyu: You know the idea of rolling that sheet of paper down the wall saying that I’m out of ideas. Like those things are not saying that I’m a great designer, but it’s just fucking funny. I think that enjoyment of doing that together is like getting to the humour of it. Sort of stepping off of design and just playing. It will be interesting whatever we do. I mean we always say that we should do a collaboration but we never do it. I mean the I think the fact that the project is based on our conversation is really good. </h3>
<h2>Ian: Thats already happened, and we know what we’re talking about. We can open up the books. Bring back Red and Blue. </h2>
<h3>Kyu: At the end of the day, I don’t want to stress over this semester. It just might be fun. I already know I’m going to be stressing over my voice and my style in Chang’s class and I know Chang’s gonna be there for me. Not just that expression but why. Where does that come from and how. What are these thoughts.</h3>
<h2>Ian: would something more concrete be the right word? Like you can paint like Jackson Pollack but until you say freedom you know. Until you actually call it freedom… </h2>
<h3>Kyu: That’s pretty interesting because Jackson Pollack is an artist. The distinction between designer as artist is like… all of these artist/ designers like David Rudnick and Sam Rolfes is that they talk about their work. They have that stage in front of museums and institutions. But we don’t have that stage. That means you can only get to that stage only when you are already recognized. There’s never a bottom. Its only after you make a name for yourselves that you can talk about your work. And its only that one guy, top down. This idea of bouncing and building from the bottom is interesting I think.</h3>
<h2>Ian: You’re reminding me about what Frank said about if you just do the thing that you like you may be able to do it forever. Just fucking around, doing rad shit and  getting exhibitions. That would be cool.</h2> 
<h3>Kyu: I’m also thinking about topics. Like we can make two typefaces on the topic of blah. You make one and I make one. And you can make whatever you want with the typeface and I can make whatever I want with mine. And the collaboration part is just… </h3>
<h2>Ian: existence. </h2>
<h3>Kyu: It’s the idea of it. </h3>
<h2>Ian: a mental space?</h2> 
<h3>Kyu: Like if you throw a dot at me what am I gonna make, if I throw a dot at you what are you gonna make? Dude Paul Elisman wrote in Free Spirit.</h3> 
<h2>Ian: What? </h2>
<h3>Kyu: The publication I wrote for Jin. </h3> 
<h2>Ian: Oh yeah? </h2>
<h3>Kyu: Yea I felt kind of like shit. Because mine was so shit but I was next to this great guy. </h3>
<h2>Ian: I mean hes like a badass because hes like “I fucking love collecting, oh it looks like a letter, its funny, its so childish, its like I’m playing with toys all day”</h2> 
<h3>Kyu: I mean he’s fucking smart.</h3> 
<h2>Ian: Yea he is, I’m not saying hes not, but its kinda rudimentary. </h2>
<h3>Kyu: I talked to Clair. </h3>
<h2>Ian: Yea I talked to her on the phone, but she wouldn’t say what we talked about.</h2>
<h3>Kyu: We talked about alot of things. It was funny.</h3> 
<h2>Ian: You fucking shade, you guys are shifty as fuck.</h2> 
<h3>Kyu: So you wanna do it? </h3>
<h2>Ian: Yea I’m gonna do the workshop for vances class now. </h2>
<h3>Kyu: Frances called me. Do you wanna eat? </h3>
<h2>Ian: I guess, what time is it?</h2>
