		<h1>Kyu's Place, January 30, 2019</h1>
		<div data-aos="fade-right"><div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Okay so I’m just going to talk with Kyu now. Well you know this whole voice thing is that I’m doing these workshops to generate forms but the hardest f*cking thing is what do those forms say. Like yea you can make a dope ass typeface but what are you gonna call it, what are you gonna say with it. That’s my issue with my workshop project. Its cool and my voice gets involved with collectivity and all that stuff. But in the end the things that I make for the project are just going to be things to promote the workshop. 
		</h2></div></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I mean you were talking about Karel Martens and Paul Eliman were sort of collecting artifacts of society. They were making type based on humanity in a way, based on our artifacts. And in that way it is a voice. There is a concept.</h3></div> 
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Yea maybe I’m shorting myself. I feel pretty candid right now, so I think I could do this project with you. I feel like when we just talk… and the book can be just bullshit you know, but we can say some profound shit. Like you know Frank, I mean I keep going back to Frank. He puts these quotes by Goethe next to a hiphop quote. And its like philosophy next to hiphop and philosophy is hiphop. What if the discourse takes a wrong turn and we start talking about JJs you know? I don’t think that necesarily bad. </h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I think there has to be some narrowing down of what exactly we want to talk about. We cant just be like GRAPHIC DESIGN, thats the conversation, and we talk about graphic design. I think we have to start with topics that we are interested in. Maybe one of them is how you make type, or maybe one of the them is the importance of style. Similar things like how do we format ourselves to function in society. Like we all need a job and we’re all worried. Theres a certain anxiety that comes with it. </h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: More about the conditions we are in.</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Yea, I mean in the end of the day the most important thing for me, is that I’m graduating. And I’m going be continuously making my work anyways, and I have been, and I will in my other class. But what I want out of my school year is sort of a culmination of thinking. Something that I can take away, these are the things I thought about and this is my friend that I thought them with. You know how Frank was talking about that Car thing? The project is the car. For me its not important whether the project is profound. I think the greatness comes in that it is honest.</h3></div>  
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Is this your answer to your question about depression? Is like the honesty and not like performing the graphic designer position. But just making honest work. We’re having these conversations, we mean them, we’re not like trying to get a job from each other. We just honestly think these thoughts.</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I also think that we can play to our strengths to create a diverse amount of work. If we make a book I know how to do a good perfect bound. We have the idea of the website and you’re really good at coding. One of the ideas I was having was type specimens based on our thoughts. When you format the work around the actual thoughts of the designer, I think there is something interesting that happens. Whenever we see David Rudnicks work, its cool but its about a club. Like the work never represents what it is. In a way it is for that. We make the work to reflect the artist. But then you dissolve what the designer is. </h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: its a very traditional mode.</h2></div> 
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I think shifting that focus into like the designers thoughts as the type specimen might just seem really fun. Like you have these really airy weird writing pieces that you do and you set it in your type. And it has this weird feeling, but you like it. </h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: I f*cking don’t like it. I feel nothing when I look at work these days. Its Frakture. Its like your handwriting.</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Its like the knife thing. </h3></div> 
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: What? </h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I was just looking at your presentation.</h3></div> 
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Oh yea that is frakture too. What were we talking about? </h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I mean you talked about Laurel Schwultz, and its similar to your work. And I was showing Jin, David Rudnicks work and he was like “isn’t that what you do?” and then I showed him onyx and he was like “thats what you do too.” and it comes to that. Like what we’re interested in and what we’re trying to get at in our work. I think it would be intersting if the work actually speaks that. I mean we don’t have to think about creating a finished piece. I think it will be a good platform to continue on as long as we can.</h3></div> 
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: No back cover. I literally blew your mind.</h2></div> 
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: You know the idea of rolling that sheet of paper down the wall saying that I’m out of ideas. Like those things are not saying that I’m a great designer, but it’s just fucking funny. I think that enjoyment of doing that together is like getting to the humour of it. Sort of stepping off of design and just playing. It will be interesting whatever we do. I mean we always say that we should do a collaboration but we never do it. I mean the I think the fact that the project is based on our conversation is really good. </h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Thats already happened, and we know what we’re talking about. We can open up the books. Bring back Red and Blue. </h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: At the end of the day, I don’t want to stress over this semester. It just might be fun. I already know I’m going to be stressing over my voice and my style in Chang’s class and I know Chang’s gonna be there for me. Not just that expression but why. Where does that come from and how. What are these thoughts.</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: would something more concrete be the right word? Like you can paint like Jackson Pollack but until you say freedom you know. Until you actually call it freedom… </h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: That’s pretty interesting because Jackson Pollack is an artist. The distinction between designer as artist is like… all of these artist/ designers like David Rudnick and Sam Rolfes is that they talk about their work. They have that stage in front of museums and institutions. But we don’t have that stage. That means you can only get to that stage only when you are already recognized. There’s never a bottom. Its only after you make a name for yourselves that you can talk about your work. And its only that one guy, top down. This idea of bouncing and building from the bottom is interesting I think.</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: You’re reminding me about what Frank said about if you just do the thing that you like you may be able to do it forever. Just fucking around, doing rad shit and  getting exhibitions. That would be cool.</h2></div> 
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I’m also thinking about topics. Like we can make two typefaces on the topic of blah. You make one and I make one. And you can make whatever you want with the typeface and I can make whatever I want with mine. And the collaboration part is just… </h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: existence. </h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: It’s the idea of it. </h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: a mental space?</h2></div> 
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Like if you throw a dot at me what am I gonna make, if I throw a dot at you what are you gonna make? Dude Paul Elisman wrote in Free Spirit.</h3></div> 
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: What? </h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: The publication I wrote for Jin. </h3></div> 
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Oh yeah? </h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Yea I felt kind of like shit. Because mine was so shit but I was next to this great guy. </h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: I mean hes like a badass because hes like “I fucking love collecting, oh it looks like a letter, its funny, its so childish, its like I’m playing with toys all day”</h2></div> 
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I mean he’s fucking smart.</h3></div> 
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Yea he is, I’m not saying hes not, but its kinda rudimentary. </h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I talked to Clair. </h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Yea I talked to her on the phone, but she wouldn’t say what we talked about.</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: We talked about alot of things. It was funny.</h3></div> 
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: You fucking shade, you guys are shifty as fuck.</h2></div> 
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: So you wanna do it? </h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Yea I’m gonna do the workshop for vances class now. </h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Frances called me. Do you wanna eat? </h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: I guess, what time is it?</h2></div>
	</article>
	<article id="Feb3">
<h1>JJ’s Kitchen Feb 3, 2019</h1>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: So what do you wanna talk about.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Does that say 482 Myrtle Avenue?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Yea dude, pretty sick right?</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Wow. 
</h3></div>
<h1>…</h1>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I already asked you a question.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Why Graphic Design?</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Yea.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: To be honest at some point I realized I wasn’t very good at regular classes at school. My sister took a photography class and then she passed on Photoshop to me.</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Like a cracked version?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Yea maybe… We might have bought it, I’m not sure.</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: So you’re a criminal.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Maybe, I mean I was downloading things off of limewire before this. But just I found making images a lot more fun than regular school work. So that’s kind of what jump started me into thinking like well how can I apply this skill I’ve developed of photo editing and cool effects.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: But you don’t do photo editing anymore?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: No. At some point I watched the Helvetica movie. It was when I was in a Summer Pre college program at UArts in Philadelphia.</h2></div>
	<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: OOoooh you fucking rich boy. Okay keep going.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: (laughs) And somewhere along there the movie kind of opened my eyes to the world of typography.</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Was it an assignment?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Was there an assignment?</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: To watch it. Or did you just find it by yourself?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: No I think I just found it.</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I see.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: What about you?</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: You didn’t answer the question!
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: I did answer the question.</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: You just said how you got into it, not why. You didn’t answer the core of the question.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: okay okay, what is the core of the question.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: You could be doing anything else right now… what makes you stay not what makes you start</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Its hard to know what your life would be like if you put yourself in somewhere else.</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Yea I think so. But Pratt gives you chances to change your major. Especially in Communications Design. So if its images why didn’t you get into photography? I don’t know I’m just throwing things at you to make you answer.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: To provoke the topic… yea… I mean I don’t want to be cocky and say I’m good at it. But I’m not good at photography.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Well why do you want to do graphic design? There must be some kind of reason…
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Yea see that’s what I thought you were getting at… like some ultimate motive, as to why you use visual communication as your primary method.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Why don’t you do art? … Continue.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: I don’t know. What about you?
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I think mine is pretty simple. I’ve always wanted to be an artist. I drew a lot. I drew since I was in kindergarden. I used to make these comic books… just A4 sheets of paper folded in half stapled. And I drew on them with my friend. I read Captain Underpants. In Captain Underpants the characters take the comics that they make and try to sell it during recess. So we tried to do that. And then I just kept doodling and taking art classes and trying to make art.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Yea.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: But as to why Graphic Design and not Art, I think it just has to do with where I’m from. I think if I make a lot of money making Art. I think I’m only serving a limited audience. I just thought that in New York a lot. The artist’s work was so special and the artist was so special. It’s not like they’re ideas were so great that they needed to show the entire world, because they don’t really care about that.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: It’s like you pay 28 dollars to get into the whitney and you may not even get what the artist is talking about.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Yea exactly. It just seemed like the word Art didn’t coincide with Fine Art. I don’t think Fine Arts is the top of the pyramid when it comes to Art. I think writing is for me.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Like the purest.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Like I don’t really feel a lot of things when I look at a painting. But when I read a book there’s so much I can get from it. 
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Yea I think that kind of made me think of my answer. I’ve told you this before, but Graphic Design is everywhere. I have this distinct memory of being at a bus stop in Philadelphia. There was this standing vertical poster. And I remember thinking, this is everywhere. I’ve never actually noticed the actual piece before because I was so  submersed in advertising and commercials.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I also like gundam boxes. When I was younger… the gundam boxes with the robots in crazy poses and stuff. Those things are all illustrations and graphic design, it’s not Fine Art. And it was so fucking cool. It’s simple drawing not like a abstract painting.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Yea, I think at a certain point you gain awareness as to someone had to make that in order to bring it to you. Someone had to make campbell soup commercials for you to know about campbell soup. Without that any soup could be good.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Wait so advertising? Like we’re talking about how its so accessible and so great but the most accessible pieces are in advertising. And both of us are not really interested in branding and advertising. There’s a lot of kids here that are way more into those things. We talk about how great it is, but is it really true for Graphic Design that’s not in an advertising sphere? Like for example Actual Source, places that work as their own firm and have an artistic voice. Do you think their work is shown everywhere?</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: No.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Like it loses that.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Yea I mean at the same time at a certain point I thought it would be really cool to be that guy that would influence other people. To say how it’s told. But I realized that it’s kind of twisted, the psychology behind it.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Behind it?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Behind advertising and selling. And that perspective kind of skews everything.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I think so. I think it’s really hard to look at the good in what is historically considered bad. Consumerism is running us to the ground. But there’s also the aspect of like hey it’s christmas and my daughter is waiting for this doll. I worked really hard and I got this doll for her. She saw the advertising months ago and just fell in love. It’s everything for her. Goods have to be circulated regardless. I guess it’s just the position we’re at where it has kind of accelerated. It makes us feel like we need more things.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: But also the Graphic Design that I…
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: You can chime in too (to Frances).
</h3></div>
<h1>Frances: I’m just out of it.
</h1>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: The Graphic Design that I learned at the Pre College place wasn’t really advertising based. It wasn’t like we’re going to make an ad for this. We got a random typeface on a sheet and you have to trace the type. We put in headphones and we listened to Chuck Brown. While we listened to the music we painted and drew. We then collaged those elements to make graphic design pieces for a music venue. And I guess that’s advertising too. But it was a process that lead me to make pieces that weren’t really based on what people want or how to sell something. It was much more freeing. It was what I was raised on.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: It’s all good. I think that’s where we’re at right now.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Right. I was watching this vine today. It was this young girl eating sour cream and onion lays. She was putting her hand into the bag and dipping the lays in the picture of the dip in the bag. Have you seen this? It’s kind of like the girl with the doll.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: You wanted lays?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: No it’s not that I wanted lays. It gave me this perspective that maybe you share that not all advertising or branding is bad. It builds stories and imagination of the product you’re using. Toys are a good example. Like if you were just given a toy maybe you wouldn’t have the story building aspect that the packaging or the things that surround the object give to it. That was kind of the lays thing.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I think it’s important to look at things in a neutral standpoint as a Graphic Designer. What you said was great. What’s great about Graphic Design is it’s accessibility. And it only happens if the company wants to distribute those things further. That’s like lays. So the great thing about Graphic Design is that we live in a consumerist age.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Yea without that we wouldn’t really have a Graphic Design culture. You can’t really have one without the other.
</h2></div>
<h1>… Food comes....</h1>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Thank you.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: The great thing is consumerism. If you’re going about Graphic Design in an artistic way, thats super limited and narrow. And you do still make culture in that one space. And I’m not saying that’s bad. Like Actual Source. But what’s the difference between that and fine art? Like they have their own shows and the books are super expensive.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Yea no one else reads those books other than graphic designers.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: its bougie Graphic Design.
</h3></div>
<h1>...</h1>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu : I think people care. That’s what I’ve got down to. People care about the work. Even the people up really high, they do care about what they’re doing. I think everybody does things that they think is right. If someone whos not a criminal, a normal person… to actually push yourself to do bad things… I don’t think it’s possible. Should we take a break?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: I want you to finish your thought.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Well, I think we can’t just say these things are bad and leave it as that. We can’t say advertising and branding, working for large corporations are bad because it pushes consumerism and the world’s going to end and all that shit. At the end of the day I think you have to think not about what you want to do. Like if I want to destroy the system. But what I can do as a Graphic Designer. If you keep pushing and fight for ideas that you think should get out there. I think people are good and it’s up to you to convince them. I think people are realizing that branding strategies don’t really work. I think they want honest work and I think it sells better. Work that is actually good work and doesn’t try to trick people.

<h1>Anda Cafe Feb 3, 2019
</h1>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: We’re at the locksmith now, aka Anda Cafe
</h2></div>
<h1>Francis: That’s insane
</h1>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: It is insane, right? It knows. It didn’t even ask me, “Do you want to allow location?”
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Well, you went into your settings and then were like, “I accept”.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: No, you’re right, I always accept. That’s the thing, I always accept.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: So, what was the question? Why graphic design?
</h3></div>
<h1>Francis: You guys talked about why you guys chose it, 
or more like why you guys began
</h1>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Well I think there’s a…
</h3></div>
<h1>[inaudible]</h1>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Ian’s having the most fun with this project. Look at his face, he’s like, “this is the best project” 
</h3></div>
<h1>...</h1>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: I mean, maybe a better way to frame the question is, what makes graphic design good?
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I think it’s a personal question. Because I think you can answer what makes graphic design good, and that’s in a general sense... I like secondary art. There’s primary art, which is like museum art, and secondary art would be like… I think I like tertiary art.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: I think it doesn’t matter what it is, it matters why you like it
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: There’s fine art, then there’s art that’s like animations and manga, and murals, and street art, and paintings by moms… What would you say secondary art is, because I think there’s a level in between fine art and graphic design
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Yeah there is, it’s like there art that isn’t necessarily considered…
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Smart?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Smart, or fine… 
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Book covers? Is the tertiary? Secondary? I don’t know...
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Applied art is like the tertiary. But why do you like it? Maybe you’re trying to say because there’s a reason behind why you like the…
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I think we’ve said that we don’t like, or the point was that fine art is too limited and graphic design is free, open… anyone can access graphic design… Anyone can access a Coke bottle. Even in papua.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Not only can anyone appreciate it or see it, but everyone can get the feeling of Coke? If that makes any sense? The Cokeness of Coke? By looking at the ad, by being surrounded by Santa Clauses that are selling you Coke, it all kind of reminisces and stirs up a Coke feeling (not to be confused with the other Coke feeling)
For me it was just another way of expression, oddly enough. It wasn’t ever really about the commercial side of it, that’s not really why I dove in. 
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: So it’s not about the accessibility?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: No, it is about the accessibility, but it was never about… I don’t know….
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I was in Animation when I first applied to Pratt, and then, I was really good at drawing my freshman year, maybe the best in my class. We took 4D, right? I fucking hated that class, because of the time-based thing? I don’t think my mind works that way. It’s all in one singular thing…
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: One moment?
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Yeah, not like, this frame this frame this frame this frame. So I switched to Illustration. Illustration felt so dumb. Like it felt like I’m working my hand, it doesn’t matter what the idea or the concept is as much. It’s like, “I want a poster of Macbeth” so I draw the king, and the knife, and the skull, it’s like...okay?… And then also you can have a teacher that will let you have ideas and stuff…
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: It’s like you could have all the parts but you couldn’t always necessarily get to the idea. You could show every aspect and you could do it technically sound, but it wasn’t as impactful to you as having a great paramount idea.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I think that’s when I was like, “oh, I fucking love Duchamp’s urinal” just as an idea. Purely an idea. I think I switched into graphic design, because I wanted to… I had this thing like, “Illustration isn’t good enough for me” that’s what I was thinking. I was also thinking “Graphic Design isn’t good enough for me.” I was very narcissistic I feel like I could do so much more with my mind. I felt like, if it’s just drawing, everyone can do it if they practice enough. I had been doing it for so long, for me it felt like it was practice.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: That’s exactly how I feel about graphic design today… We’re dancing around the topic a little, but…
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I don’t think so. I think it’s about psychology and knowing people. It’s communication. It’s how you communicate something. The most important thing is you have to know what people understand and what people feel....
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: The empathy thing.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Yeah, I feel like I know how people think, in a way. There are all different kinds of people, but there is a general sense of “this will make someone feel in this way” and that’s so fun for me. It’s like, “how can I fucking cunt this motherfucker when they look at the work?” Even if it’s not cunting, but getting into their head and shift something.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Yeah, I think that, for me that came about most effectively when I got into typography. Even the most basic change in how a letter or how a word is presented can give the word a completely different connotation…
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Like Garamond and Baskerville? 
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Like Garamond and Baskerville and Times… 
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: On a micro level?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: On a very detailed level, you read it differently.
</h2></div>
<h1>Francis: That thing was falling off the first time I came in here. 
Now it’s dangling!
</h1>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: This place just opened.
</h2></div>
<h1>Francis: Yeah I know! Interesting...
</h1>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: So yeah, psychology was also very interesting for me, but it wasn’t necessarily “how could I change someone’s mind” it was more “how can I understand how my mind has been changed” and from that world, influence other people positively by communicating. I never had the..
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: The cunting?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: The cunting…yeah…
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: You didn’t like the cunting… it’s too strategy based…? I think the micro level is pretty cool too. For me, to a certain extent, type seems less… my brain is more inclined to the actual saying…? I guess it’s just more of the macro level that I’m kind of interested in, where if certain words are changed this way, that way, that way, the meaning is changed.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Right… I think it’s all somewhat tied. But I think if we get into that we could get into the whole sans-serif conversation we’re going to have.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I still don’t think we have the right answers, we’re just sort of just… going ‘round and around…
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: There’s no other way, but…
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Like the Film Forum poster? It was during Eric Wren’s class. I remember having so much fun giving the viewer a little “ooohh,” like a little brain gift. It was a poster for all the shows and times and I set it like an eye test.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: I remember.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: So the concept was that you have to know what you’re seeing. You have to be a trained eye to be someone that enjoys going to indie movies. And it’s not the mass. So I think someone who goes to Film Forum and really like Film Forum, when they look at it… it’s not a lot, you’re not giving them the best thing in the world, but it’s a little gift in the brain. It just feels good. You know what I mean? It’s just a thought by another person. And it makes me feel good about what I’m doing.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: One of the most influential posters in my entire history of seeing graphic design was done by this graphic designer Inge Druckrey. I think there’s also something to be said about, is the immediacy, or if not even the immediacy, but the difficulty of the puzzle. If we’re to say that these forms of visual communication that we do are like puzzles, like a purely type poster by Frank DeRose might be the easiest puzzle because you just read it, and you understand. But there are other graphic designers, like that guy you work with… (cut all this out...) who goes to Cranbrook.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Visual?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Well they’re both visual, it’s just that one gives you the meaning, the idea, the concept very immediately, and the other one, I kind of have to come up with the answer, it’s a very difficult puzzle to figure out. And it’s not like there’s always a straight-forward answer either.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Is there really a puzzle or is it just coolness? Trying to be the “next new thing”?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: I think there’s definitely…
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Thought process?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Definitely a process and an idea when you were making it. I think that any artist, even if they don’t know what they’re doing when they approach the canvas, comes there as they are. Something comes about.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I think the puzzle can just be… I don’t think cool is bad. I never thought cool was ever bad, I’m just saying is it really about creating new form and weird forms. We’re going off topic…
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Yeah we’re going off topic. I would say “what’s the point in that” but…
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Yeah, that’s another topic. I like that topic. I like the coolness. I fucking love the coolness. People only shit on being cool, because it’s not cool enough. If you’re cool enough, then no one can shit on you. You know what I mean? If you’re just trying to make cool typeface, you’re just trying to make cool graphics, no one can say that to you if you’re cool enough. If someone tries to say that to you, it means you’ve failed. You failed at being cool enough. That’s why there’s so much hate in being cool, it’s because you’re not cool enough. You’ve never seen that before. You’re trying to do something new. It’s not new.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Aw man. I don’t know.. I don’t know.. But why graphic design… I mean, I kind of agree with you but it’s also… I don’t know but I’m thinking of it kind of like high school, to be honest. What it means to be cool in high school.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Cool kids sucked? I guess “cool” as in visually interesting, without focusing on the conceptual side.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Okay, so the most beautiful person in high school. They won the lottery, they’re fucking beautiful as an 18 year old, right? 
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: It’s the eye candy thing? Everyone loves looking at the girl that’s beautiful, right?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Or like looking at the most profound concepts visually represented. That can also be cool.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Of course. I guess cool is the wrong word, but I like using it.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Because it’s cool? It’s cool to say it?
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Yeah, I love cool.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: I guess what we can say is or what we’ve arrived at is that graphic design is very public.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: It’s about people. It’s about talking to people. I think why fine art has to come into the conversation is because fine art is like “what is this?” (points to chest). Like, you’re looking inside yourself, and trying to learn… I’m not really sure if I’m saying the right thing...
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Well, it’s hard to define what fine art is, because it’s an open…
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Of course, but the artist doesn’t think about the community first or the people first…
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Not always, but sometimes.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Like Warhol doesn’t say “oh this is going to fucking sell, people are going to eat it up.”
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Are you kidding!?
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I mean, Warhol’s not the right example, I’m just saying a pure artist, like a singer or a songwriter...
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Comes from the soul
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: ...Someone who want to do what he’s doing, right? Someone who wants to make beautiful abstract paintings, he’s doing it because he wants to do it not because he has some sort of social obligation towards creating something that people can see. But I think why we’re so interested in graphic design is that it does think about people. And that’s the difference between fine art and graphic design
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: And I also think that why we bring up fine art is because graphic design has of course been taken up by fine art, and that proves the value of, and the strength of graphic design, is that as a public art form, was recognized as being stronger at moving people than the fine art world was.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Are you talking about Andy Warhol?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Andy Warhol, Ed Ruscha… like that kind of makes graphic design interesting, that in the battlefield, it kind of won. In a way. That’s why graphic design.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Did that answer your question?
</h3></div>
<h1>Francis: That’s one way of going about it, kind of eliminating, 
why not this, why not that, that is why this one.
</h1>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Why else?
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I was talking about accessibility. I mean, accessibility is good, but that’s not the reason, I think it’s just because we’re not that important in the grand scheme of things, it’s not like we’re, fucking, a light in this world and we have some grand thing, i think what’s more important is “how can I say or reach out” and give something to people, not just explode from the inner soul in artistic grandeur, but how can i just go out and talk to people and reach out.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: You can also do that with art.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Of course, but I guess the motive is different.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: No.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: You’re right. I guess contemporary is different. There’s all these artists who make these social pieces, but isn’t that graphic design?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: That’s what I’m saying, is that these graphic mechanisms or… the methods of graphic design have infiltrated the art world and so that is why you see…
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I don’t like when art is used to do political. Okay, I do, but… This is getting way to much… I guess the way I was defining art up until now is through the “ideal artist”
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Who’s the ideal artist to you?
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Duchamp. Or, Van Gogh. Pollock. Goya.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: That’s a good one, Goya. Yeah, for the most part Goya didn’t have rhyme or reason.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Yeah, that’s what I mean, “this is humanity,” coming from the soul. Not “this shit happened with the wall, I’m going to make some weird paintings about Trump” it just loses that value for me.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: I’m also kind of questioning the difference between art and graphic design, which is where this topic is kind of leading into. It’s like, “I can’t read a painting that doesn’t have an explanation” is like a dumbed down way of putting it, but I’m thinking about old memento mori paintings. It’s where the artist would put a skull on the table and then it’s like “oh, I’m reminded of death” that’s like the goal of putting that skull on that table. But visual signifiers have always been in painting and in art. Especially in old paintings, religious paintings, where a person might have something in there hand and therefore you can tell which figure they are. There’s always been these graphic design elements. So what is graphic design?
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I think it still goes back to the reason why people do things. Sure there’s this new artist who’s in the social sphere. I think the distinction is that an artist can’t be a graphic designer but a graphic designer can be an artist. The goal of the soul, the “soul’s goal”, is that an artist can’t be anything else in the world. You can’t really define them in one way or another, at least in my idea of what real art should be, is that it’s people who have to do it. They can’t do anything else. That’s who they are. But a graphic designer can also be an artist…
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: There’s a conundrum there. Because if they can also be an artist, then aren’t they also doomed to artistude? And also if a graphic designer is also an artist, then aren’t they also shorting their artist-ness, and therefore, artists? 
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: You know what I mean though? Does it make sense? 
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: I’m trying to logic this out. Do you see what I mean?
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Yeah, I think what I said, that artists are people who can’t be anywhere else, is kind of true.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Okay, so take Jeff Koons, is he an artist? Because he went and did banking for a while so he could fund his art? Or is he not a great artist?
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: It’s very complicated. I mean, I never liked any of his stuff.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: No one likes his work.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I don’t know if I can be the person to define what’s art
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Sure, we’re not here to be like “This is what this should be!” because as soon as you say that, someone’s going to be like, “I found a hole, I found a world that I can build.” So it’s kind of hard to define anything.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I think we answered the question though. 
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian:about why graphic design?
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Yeah, because we want to think more about people than ourselves. We want to communicate instead of shouting. I think there’s a difference between what art does and what graphic design does. If you’re a baby, and the baby is trying to talk, there’s a difference between the baby trying to communicate to the mom that she wants milk, and the baby screaming for milk, and they come from two different places. Screaming is like, “I want to be heard,” and trying to talk is like “I want to communicate something to you, I want to have you receive information from me.” This is kind of complicated… Based on “I want to be heard,” rather than “trying to communicate.” I don’t think we have to define it even, though, I think it’s just because we like people. It’s Art. I think it gets so much deeper and deeper.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: I kind of agree with you in a way. I think both give you the milk, is the weird thing. You could be the baby that talks, or you could be the baby that talks, but either way, you get the milk, right? Most of the time…
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I think there is the position of the mom that we’re not thinking of, which may be the viewer. And the mom has to hear the shouting baby and calm the baby down and has to interact with that baby, and she’s not happy. And maybe it’s not a direct relation, but art can be that the intent of the piece may not be based on trying to be a good factor in society, or for the viewer, it’s not like “I’m doing good for the person,” it’s just “I’m doing art.” The very simple explanation that we’re all forgetting is that fine art is not financially stable. I mean that’s the basic reason.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: I mean, it can be.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Do you want to be a fine artist?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Wouldn’t we all like to be? It’s a lucky position to be in, but I get you. I mean, if anyone, I think the philosophers are kind of fucked the most
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Are there any contemporary philosophers? Malcolm Gladwell?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Slavoj Žižek?
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I think “why graphic design” might be different for each of us, and we’re trying to find one singular solution that might not even exist
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Well that’s a fact in itself.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: So there might be a solution?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: No, just the idea of subjectivity. That there is no fixed…
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Is there a fixed?
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: I mean, there is always the room in between us.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: You might have very different reasons for “why graphic design” than I do.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Isn’t that the question that we’re asking? Why we do graphic design?
</h2></div>
<h1>Francis: Isn’t it why you guys are doing graphic design? 
Why be graphic designers?
</h1>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Accessibility, People-focused…Communication… GIFS?!
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: I kind of want to go back to that thing of “the people...” We care about people, right. Because I always considered myself to be antisocial, I would never consider myself to be poetic with people?
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I remember I made this page when I was really young, I made an anonymous page on Facebook, swearing at the principal and stuff…. I think that is still the same headspace where I care about the society, even if it’s a small school society, and this person is doing something bad, I have to do something, even when I’m like 17, 16, it kind of comes back to what we’re doing. There’s the word “cultural intermediaries,” where we present culture for the world. Present this world around us. Even this place, JJ’s, they are all spaces created, and there’s branding, there’s sheets of paper, the menu… It’s a world that we’re creating.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: And you have to translate. You have to take the ideals of a company and boil it down to…
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: “You’re going to fuck around, and I don’t want to work with you,” or “you’re trying to do something great, let me let that greatness show through,” I think that’s where it comes down to “we care about what people need.”
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: “We care about what people need”
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Yeah, or what the society needs. Society is another word for people. That’s smart.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: I guess, to reframe the question “why graphic design,” the question kind of turned into “why graphic design as opposed to other forms of visual communication. And that’s weird because some people call graphic design visual communication… Other forms of representation maybe? I don’t know. Artists could say, “I am making this mark, not only am I taking my umwelt, my world around me, not only am I putting it into a painting, but I’m also representing that society to people so that people can better understand themselves in a way that isn’t dogmatic and doesn’t tell you what to do.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Isn’t that what I’m doing? That was my senior thesis statement!
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: I mean this entire fucking time I was like, “oh wait, aren’t you an artist?” So it’s like, yes, we care about people, but all artists do too, or don’t other people care about people too? Don’t people who make chairs care about people too?
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Yeah, and we also don’t care that much. I would say missionaries care more about people than graphic designers, I would think that human aid people care more about people than graphic designers, I would say doctors care more about people than graphic designers. I think what we care about is society and space and the world, less so people…
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: There’s a test online that you can take about love languages.
</h2></div>
<h1>Francis: We did it.
</h1>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: You did it? What’s Kyu’s love language?
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: Touch.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Touch? That’s what I’m saying. You might be touch, but other people might be quality time. So there are different ways of showcasing your love for people.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: but I want to touch the African kids. I want to comb their hair and be like, “oh you poor child.”
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: No no no no… what I’m saying is that a missionary or doctor is doing it in one way while an artist is doing it in another way.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I also think that there’s the distinction where we’re not saving lives, we’re looking at the bigger picture. We’re looking at culture and society and things like that rather than “I care so much about people I want everyone to live forever and to live a full life.”
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: ...but the hospital tweet that Laurel wrote? That’s a good tweet. Do you remember that tweet? It was something like, my ideal workplace for graphic design would be the structure of a hospital, because everyone is there to help each other and everyone has a specific role that they play and everyone is there to heal and I was like… Fuck.. that’s decent.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: But also everyone has room numbers and everyone’s kind of super steril.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Compartmentalized. Which is also an interesting world to live in, which I question about Laurel, but… That’s a different story.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I look at Jin, and he reads all these philosophy books, and whenever I go to class, you get text essays about society and culture. It makes me wonder that a graphic designer has this mindset, looking at society. “Cultural intermediaries” can decide what goes through, what I can make better, what I can make sell better, and what needs to sell better, and what needs to get out there, and in that way we’re creating that world of what needs to get made or what we think needs to get made. 
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: And the impact of that is actually through money, which is something that is pretty revolutionary. We can say, “this will sell, this will not sell” and in that way, protest what is good, what is bad, and be that cultural intermediary that other forms of communication may not form.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: I watched this thing about Paula Scher designing the HighLine. She got zero money for designing that stuff, but it’s not about whether it sells or not, but what reaches people. I mean, obviously, money is the biggest thing. But it’s not the root.
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: Money was a bad word for it. To expand the concept would be “value.” Because a park is free time, and that has value.
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: So you’re just kind of presenting… Things… “this place is great, come to this place!”
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: “It has value.”
</h2></div>
<div data-aos="fade-left"><h3>Kyu: My brain… My brain hurts...
</h3></div>
<div data-aos="fade-right"><h2>Ian: We were here for… 47 minutes… About to close...
